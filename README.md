Hex-Pals/Compadres
========
JavaScript hex map generator including obstacle creation and deletion, a pair of PCs with a special swing/cleave attack, and melee foes utilizing A* pathfinding to target the nearest PC.

Foes and obstacles must be hand-placed. Foes are destroyed if a PC occupies their space and the player clicks either the 'Enemy Cleanup' or 'End Turn' button. 'End Turn' also causes all foes to move one cell closer to the nearest PC.

<b>Coding Wishlist:</b> random seeding, improved algorithm for better obstacle placement, level goal/collectibles, victory condition

<b>Gameplay Wishlist:</b> multiple PCs with unique special attacks (push/pull/slide foes, move then attack/attack then move), namable unique team-up attacks based on PC pairing (swing/cleave, throw/ranged, summon obstacles/danger zone, destroy obstacles, stun/petrify, summon a rock/robot with no actions but can be teamed-up with), Iron Fist kung-fu attack name-generator, level-up/progression mechanic, multiple classes of obstacles (water, lava, elevation, traps), multiple enemy types (ranged, flying, swarm, leader), enemy palette-swap/reskinning based on level/quest theme (melee zombie == melee robot, etc), avatar customization (choose colors or design/color mask)
