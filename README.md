Hex-Pals/Compadres
========
Hand-place foes and obstacles. Destroy foes by moving a PC to their space and then clicking either the 'Enemy Cleanup' or 'End Turn' button. 'End Turn' also causes all foes to move one cell closer to the nearest PC. PCs must be adjacent to use special attack.

<b>Coding Wishlist:</b> random seeding, improved algorithm for better obstacle placement, level goal/collectibles, victory condition

<b>Gameplay Wishlist:</b> multiple PCs with unique special attacks (push/pull/slide foes, move then attack/attack then move), namable unique team-up attacks based on PC pairing (swing/cleave, throw/ranged, summon obstacles/danger zone, destroy obstacles, stun/petrify, summon a rock/robot with no actions but can be teamed-up with), Iron Fist kung-fu attack name-generator, level-up/progression mechanic, multiple classes of obstacles (water, lava, elevation, traps), multiple enemy types (ranged, flying, swarm, leader), enemy palette-swap/reskinning based on level/quest theme (melee zombie == melee robot, etc), avatar customization (choose colors or design/color mask)
